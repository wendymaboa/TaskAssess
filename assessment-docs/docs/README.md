# Custom Mobile App Development for FitLife Studios

> FitLife Studios, a fitness center with three locations, has contracted our company to develop a custom mobile app to enhance their client experience. The app will enable users to book classes, track fitness progress, purchase memberships, and view personalized workout plans. It will be available on both iOS and Android platforms and will integrate with FitLife's existing scheduling software and payment processing systems.
> The app is designed to support an initial user base of 1,000 active users at launch, with scalability for future growth. The project, set to be completed within four months, has a total budget of $120,000. The key stakeholders in this project include the Studio Manager, Brand Manager, Lead Trainer, and the IT Consultant, each playing a crucial role in the development and integration process.
