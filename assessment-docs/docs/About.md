### Integration Considerations
- Stripe or Paypal needs to be set up early in the backend development phase.
- Integration with Mindbody or Acuity Scheduling ia essential for bookings so it must be done during the mobile app development phase
- Push notification services must be integrated after the core features are implemented.
